# comparing_pi_estimates
This estimates pi using two different methods. The first is the classic Monte Carlo method. The second is by finding a partial sum of the Basel Problem, and then multiplying by 6 and taking the square root. For different thresholds of $\epsilon$ between our estimate and $\pi$, we determine how many trials/summands need to be used.
